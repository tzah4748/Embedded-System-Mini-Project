    <b>Final project</br>
Course 10110, Embedded System</b></p>


## ***Introduction:***
This is the final project for an Embedded System Course (10110).  
In this course we've studied a specific board that was provided to us in class.  
As a final project I've decided to make a game called "Defuse The Bomb".


## ***Game Explanation:***
This game is quite simple, once we press "A" to start playing, the player has 1 minute in to solve four mathematical questions with increasing diffculity, every right answer will grant the player a code number and a number that represents it's "index" (this is called "line" number in the game).  
After solving all four questions, the player has to press "#" to input the code for the bomb, the right code will set off the bomb and the wrong code... well we all know what happens next ;)


## ***Hardware:***
- The board itself:

- Board's processor: MICROCHIP [PIC32MX460F512L](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC32MX460F512L)
- In-Circuit Emulator: [MPLAB REAL ICE](http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DV244005)

## ***Modules Used:***
As part of the project requirements I had to use at least 4 modules from the board.   
I've used the following modules:  
1. LCD Display - It's purpose is to communicate with the player and show him messages.
2. Keyboard - The player's input delivery is done with this keyboard.
3. Buzzer - It ticks faster as time goes down to imitate a real bomb.
4. Timer - With the timer we can tell when one minute has passed or when the buzzer has to tick faster as time goes down.
5. Interrupts - The interrupts mechanism listens for the Timer and reacts according to the time passed, for example: as time goes down the mechanism interrups the Buzzer and reactivates it to tick faster.
6. LCD-G - Graphical LCD is used to show the player the mathematical question he has to solve.


## ***Installtion:***
Assuming you got the board and the required hardware:
1. Download and open, MPLAB IDE (I personally used v8.66).
>[Download MPLAB IDE v8.66](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MPLAB_IDE_v8_66.zip)
2. Create a new project with "project wizard", select the "PIC32MAX460F512L" device (or any other device you might be using), when asked to add files, add the "v1.c", finish the creation.
3. Open "Debugger" tab and select REAL ICE as your debugger tool.
4. Press "Build All", then Program and to start just press "Run".

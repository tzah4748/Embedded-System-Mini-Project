    <b>Final project</br>
Course 10110, Embedded System</b></p>


## ***Introduction:***
This is the final project for an Embedded System Course (10110).  
In this course we've studied a specific board that was provided to us in class.  
As a final project I've decided to make a game called "Defuse The Bomb".


## ***Game Explanation:***
This game is quite simple, once we press "A" to start playing, the player has 1 minute in to solve four mathematical problems with increasing diffculity, every right answer will grant the player a code number and a number that represents it's "index" (this is called "line" number in the game).  
After solving correctly all four problems, the player has to press "#" to input the code for the bomb, if the code is right the bomb will turn off and stop ticking! else... well we all know what happens next ;)
